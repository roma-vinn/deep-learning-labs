Task:
1. Implement a nn model based on the Inception architecture. No restrains about the model size, it can differ from the original paper. But inception block should be implemented from scratch.
2. Augmentation. Choose your own set of augmentation in order to improve model's accuracy.
3. Train model on the EMNIST digits dataset.
